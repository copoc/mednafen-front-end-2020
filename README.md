# mednafen-front-end-2020
https://mednafen.github.io/ is a multiplatform rewinding featured game multi-console simulator, which is being developed in hi speed manner, i'd reckon. its launching is not trivial, the mednafen needs wrapping front-end. i use linux python front end https://github.com/hristoast/mfe
which is late for several steps from mednafen itself
i edited 2 config files and want it work out of the box.
and this is that box.
